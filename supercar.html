    <h3><p><i> When defining a supercar, it's challenging to find specific language to define the differences between high-end luxury vehicles such as supercars, hypercars, and muscle cars. Things like speed, horsepower, price, or the car's aesthetic may come to mind. But there's no set measurement for each of these categories. There are some nuances between the cars that provide some guidance.</i></p></h3>

        <p><b>Ok, so the first one on this list is technically from the last century, the 1990s to be exact, but it’s here as a benchmark and baseline for the models that follow. A top speed of 231 mph. Back in 1992, no other production car had ever gone that fast. It was mind-blowing. But that’s what the McLaren F1 did; blow minds. With its feather-weight carbon-fiber chassis, single-minded focus on shaving weight, and a bespoke 6-liter, 627 hp BMW V-12 for power, it could sear to 60 mph in just 3.2 seconds.</b></p>
        <li><h3>Ferrari Enzo</h3></li>

        <p><b>Ferrari’s biggest sensation of the 21st century remains the Enzo, a V-12-powered, mid-engined monster named after the founder of the company, a man whose legacy continues to inspire the latest supercars from Maranello. Designed by then head of design at Pininfarina, Ken Okuyama, the car captivated its audience in 2002 at the Paris Motor Show.</b></p>
        <li><h3>Bugatti Veyron Super Sport
        </h3></li>

        <p><b>Bugatti stormed back to the modern age from the pages of automotive history with the 2005 Veyron, which announced its intentions with quad-turbo twin-V8s that made an astonishing 1,200 hp. Fast forward a half-decade, and the Super Sport version of the Veyron promptly claimed the Guinness Book of Records title in 2010 as world’s fastest production car with a 260 mph run at Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg test track.

            The Veyron Super Sport has been eclipsed by the 1,500 hp Bugatti Chiron Super Sport which, driven by Andy Wallace, recently hit 304 mph in testing. However, nobody is apt to forget the Veyron—the machine that made the modern version of Bugatti what it is today.</b></p>
            <li><h3>Ferrari LaFerrari

            <p><b> 2013 was an auspicious year for supercars, with no fewer than three major releases debuting from McLaren, Porsche, and Ferrari and earning the “Holy Trinity” nickname. Though fiercely individual, each of the trio claimed a hybrid power-train layout.

                Of the three, only the Ferrari LaFerrari boasted a V-12 engine— and a raucous, naturally aspirated one, at that. The LaFerrari also happened to be the most powerful (and, unofficially at least) the most charismatic of the wild bunch. Eponymously named to suggest it was the quintessence of the Ferrari nameplate, the 950 hp hypercar may go down in history not only as the pinnacle of its era, but also as one of the greatest prancing horses of all time.  B.W.

            <p> <b> On August 2, 2019, Bugatti’s Chiron Super Sport became the first series-production automobile to break the 300 mph mark (more precisely, 304.773 mph) on a German test track with official Bugatti test driver and Le Mans–winner Andy Wallace behind the wheel. Inspired by that achievement, the manufacturer created the eponymously named Chiron Super Sport 300+.

                Limited to 30 examples worldwide, it’s distinguished by carbon bodywork that extends the longtail by 9.8 inches, along with aero enhancements that improve high-speed performance by further lowering drag and increasing downforce. It’s about power too, where the 8.0-liter, W-16 quad-turbocharged engine produces 1,600 hp, 100 hp more than a “garden-variety” Chiron. As regards fuel consumption, depending on how fast you drive, your mileage may vary.</b></p>
